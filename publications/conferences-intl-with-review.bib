  abstract = {{Extending a language by embedding within it another language presents
	significant parsing challenges, especially if the embedding is recursive.
	The composite grammar is likely to be nondeterministic as a result
	of tokens that are valid in both the host and the embedded language.
	In this paper we examine the challenges of embedding the Tom language
	into a variety of general-purpose high level languages. Tom provides
	syntax and semantics for advanced pattern matching and tree rewriting
	facilities. Embedded Tom constructs are translated into the host
	language by a preprocessor, the output of which is a composite program
	written purely in the host language. Tom implementations exist for
	Java, C, C#, Python and Caml. The current parser is complex and difficult
	to maintain. In this paper, we describe how Tom can be parsed using
	island grammars implemented with the Generalised LL (GLL) parsing
	algorithm. The grammar is, as might be expected, ambiguous. Extracting
	the correct derivation relies on our disambiguation strategy which
	is based on pattern matching within the parse forest. We describe
	different classes of ambiguity and propose patterns for resolving
	them.}},
