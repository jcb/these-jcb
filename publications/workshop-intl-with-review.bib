  abstract = {Model Driven Engineering (MDE) advocates the use of Model Transformations
	(MT) in order to automate repetitive development tasks. Many different
	model transformation languages have been proposed with a significant
	development cost as classical elements like expressions, statements,
	. . . must be developed from scratch in each language. The Tom language
	is a shallow extension of Java tailored to describe and implement
	transformations of tree based data-structures. Expressions, statements
	and many other elements rely directly on Java constructs and are
	thus almost costless. A key feature of Tom allows to map any Java
	data-structure to tree based data abstractions that can be accessed
	by pattern matching. In this paper, we present how this approach
	can be extended in order to describe model transformations, and in
	particular EMF (Eclipse Modeling Framework) based model transformations.
	This allows to provide a low cost transformation language both on
	the language tool development and on the developpers training side.},

  abstract = {{Model Driven Engineering (MDE) is now widely used in many industrial
	contexts such as the AeroSpace domain which requires a high level
	of system safety. Model-checking is one of the formal techniques
	which are considered to ensure a system compliance to its requirements.
	It relies on verification dedicated languages to model the system
	under verification. In order to ease the use of these tools, model
	transformations are provided that translate the end user provided
	input model of the system to the formal languages than can be verified.
	In order to rely on these activities for system certification, the
	correctness of these transformation steps must be assessed (qualification
	of the development and verification tools). One of the goal of our
	work is to provide tools to implement the transformation steps between
	the end user source languages used for the system development and
	the target languages used for formal verification. In this paper,
	we present a Tom rule-based approach which is used in a research
	project involving industrial partners: Airbus and Ellidiss.}},
