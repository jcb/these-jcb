  abstract = {This manual contains information for Tom version 2.7. Tom is a language
	extension which adds new matching primitives to languages like C,
	Java, and Caml. Although rich and complex, Tom is not a stand-alone
	language: like a preprocessor, it strongly relies on the underlying
	language (C, Java, or Caml), called host-language in the following.
	To this language, Tom adds several constructs. The main construct,
	\%match, is similar to the match primitive found in functional languages:
	given an object (called subject) and a list of patterns-actions,
	the match primitive selects the first pattern that matches the subject
	and performs the associated action. The sub ject against which we
	match can be any object, but in practice, this ob ject is usually
	a tree-based data-structure, also called term in the algebraic programming
	community. The match construct may be seen as an extension of the
	classical switch/case construct. The main difference is that the
	discrimination occurs on a term and not on atomic values like characters
	or integers: the patterns are used to discriminate and retrieve information
	from an algebraic data structure. There- fore, Tom is a good language
	for programming by pattern matching, and it is particularly well-suited
	for programming various transformations on trees/terms or Xml data-structures.},
